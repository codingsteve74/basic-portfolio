                                    I enjoy foods of all kinds and types and I enjoy making and learning to make new foods as well as getting to learn new styles 
                                    of cooking as well. 
                                </p>

                                    I think that family time is an essential part of our lives. I do not take that for granted. I believe that all should come together
                                    and enjoy some time together. Whether it be around the table for dinner or an outing but the point being is that it is essential.

                                    <p>
                                        I enjoy fixing cars and/or restoring them as much as I can. Learing to bring things back to life from an all but destroyed
                                        nature that they are currently in, is pretty satisfying as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I grew up wiht my dad being a mechanic for decades and I was able to learn quite a bit from him. Although things with cars and trucks
                                        are much different now with all the electronis and modules then they had back in his day. Mainly why in today's time they are not actully
                                        called mechanics anymore as they are referred to auto technicians due to the Knowledge they have to have these days.
