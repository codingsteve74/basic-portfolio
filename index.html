        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As an aspiring front end web developer/web designer, I want to learn everything I can in this area. I have been to a lot of different places within the 
          United State. I have worked a lot of various jobs and just love all there is about web design/development. I know that everything especially tech and 
          technologies are an always updating and evolving world and I love to try to stay with the way its evolving. My different jobs have taught me many things 
          such as patience, problem solving, critical thinking, thinking outside the box, and a constant learner.</p>
        <p>Bringing what I have learned over the years to web design/development will bring hopefully bring more or different thinking processes to my way of 
          thinking and coding websites. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals here are to learn all I can that I don’t know and learn the new things that I have never new about in front end development coding. 
          I want to expand my knowledge in many different areas including but not limited to the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Angular</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I'd like to do, is to work for myself as a freelance web designer/developer at some time in the future. Where all I need is my laptop and my skills and 
          knowledge to dive and create amazing and impressive web pages for clients.
