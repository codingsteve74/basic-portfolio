******NOTE

I have inluded a normalize file too as all websites should have this. This is not a style file that I am tweeking it is just there to keep things normal for viewing purposes
if i lose points on this point then that is fine. 

I am not a new person to web design just things from some Javascript and up so I am coding from that point and that does mean using resets and normalizations.
